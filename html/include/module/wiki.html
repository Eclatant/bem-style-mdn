    <p>The <strong><code>Promise</code></strong> object is used for deferred and asynchronous computations. A <code>Promise&nbsp;</code>represents an operation that hasn't completed yet, but is expected in the future.</p>

    <h2 id="Description">Description</h2>

    <p>A <code><strong>Promise</strong></code>&nbsp;represents a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers to an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of the final value, the asynchronous method returns a <em>promise</em> of having a value at some point in the future.</p>

    <p>A <code>Promise</code> is in one of these&nbsp;states:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><em>pending</em>: initial state, not fulfilled or rejected.</li>
        <li><em>fulfilled</em>: meaning that the operation completed successfully.</li>
        <li><em>rejected</em>: meaning that the operation failed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A pending&nbsp;promise can become either <em>fulfilled</em> with a value, or <em>rejected</em> with a reason (error). When either of these happens, the associated handlers queued up by a promise's <code>then</code> method are called. (If the promise has already been fulfilled or rejected when a corresponding handler is attached, the handler will be called, so there is no race condition between an asynchronous operation completing and its handlers being attached.)</p>

    <p>As the <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then" title="The then() method returns a Promise. It takes two arguments, both are callback functions for the success and failure cases of the Promise."><code>Promise.prototype.then</code></a></code> and <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/catch" title="The catch() method returns a Promise and deals with rejected cases only. It behaves the same as calling Promise.prototype.then(undefined, onRejected)."><code>Promise.prototype.catch</code></a></code> methods return promises, they can be chained—an operation called <em>composition</em>.</p>
